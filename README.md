### Digital Arts and Animation

**March 5th**

Last semester, I had not been enrolled in this course, so I didn't have a portfolio before. However, I had just created this repository today. So far in this class, I have experimented with Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Animate, and Adobe Character Animate. These are different tools that I can use to create any type of digital art. In Adobe Photoshop, I started with a simple animation in the form of a GIF.

_This is a simple GIF of a rainbow._

To further my understanding in Adobe Photoshop, I created two complex GIFs. I learned to pick high-quality pictures,so when I transform the picture, it has the same quality. I also learned to crop the picture from the background. This was essential in the first animation shown below. I learned to create mulitple keyframes on timeline to create animations in Photoshop.

_This is the second complex GIF that uses the rectangle and text tool to create an animation advertising Photoshop._

In Adobe Animate, I have done mulitple experiments. I thought this was the Adobe tool that I enjoyed the most. I was able to learn multiple things with Adpbe Animate.

_This is my first experiment in Animate. It helped me learn the skills of onion skinning, and creating an animation with a story._

_In this experiment, I was able to create an animated version of a real object. I was very proud when I finished making it, because the resembelence was amazaing. Though my skills are still basic, I learned how to tweak objects to how I want._

_For this experiment, I learned the new skills of shape and classic tweening, as well as having a text follow a motion path. I thought this was really cool._

_I used my tweeing knowledge to create a sort of 3-D motion._

_In this one, I was able to use the bone tool to make different parts of the body an object. This way I am able to control the motion of the skeleton._

In Character Animate, I was able to customize my character and have it do whatever I was doing. For this, I had to let it access my camera and microphone. I wasn't so excited about experimenting with it, but I understood how to use the Rigging function. I did think it was pretty cool to see that it copied what I did, and it helped me link to animations today. 
_I'm not able to upload the project, sorry._
